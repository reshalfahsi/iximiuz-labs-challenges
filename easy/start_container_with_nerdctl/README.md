# **Start and Inspect a Container With contaiNERD CTL (nerdctl)**

In this challenge, you will need to start a container without Docker (or its high-level alternatives like Podman). Instead, you will use a much more lightweight combination of containerd and a Docker-compatible CLI for containerd called *nerdctl*.

You can use any container image you like, but we recommend choosing a long-running container (e.g., ``nginx``) because to complete this challenge you will also need to inspect the running container and answer a few questions about it.

> **Hint #1:**
>
> **nerdctl** tries to be as compatible with the Docker CLI as possible. If you're familiar with Docker, you already know how to start a container with contaiNERD CTL. And if you're not, try solving this [Docker 101 challenge](https://labs.iximiuz.com/challenges/start-container-with-docker) first.

To keep track of containers, nerdctl assigns a unique ID to each of them. Can you find the ID of the container that you've just started?

> **Hint #2:**
>
> It's an easy one - ``nerdctl --help`` will show you the way.

Now, when you have a running container, let's try to understand what it actually is.

Did you know that [Linux containers are regular processes](https://iximiuz.com/en/posts/oci-containers/)? Can you locate the main container's process? What is its PID?

> **Hint #3:**
>
> If containers are *regular Linux processes*, will they show up in ``ps`` or ``top`` output? ðŸ¤”

> **Hint #4:**
>
> Entered a PID of a process that definitely belongs to the container, but the solution checker doesn't accept it? One of the key Docker (hence, containerd) design principles is to run **one service per container**. However, it doesn't mean that every container will have only one process inside. Actually, more often than not, you'll find a whole process tree inside a container. Try identifying the root process of that tree. That's what the checker expects.

> **Hint #5:**
>
> Still having trouble? You can always fall back to ``nerdctl inspect`` to cross-check your findings.

Approximating containers to *regular Linux processes* is helpful, but it's not very accurate. Thinking of containers as of *boxes for processes* might be even more helpful at times.

From inside the box, it may look like the containerized app is running on its own machine. In particular, such a virtualized environment will have its own network interface and an IP address. Can you find the IP address of the container that you've just started?

> **Hint #6:**
>
> There are many ways to find the container IP address. If you're a Linux guru, you can try your luck with ``ip netns`` and ``ip addr``.

> **Hint #7:**
>
> Don't feel comfortable messing with Linux network namespaces? You can always use the ``nerdctl inspect`` command to find the container IP address.
