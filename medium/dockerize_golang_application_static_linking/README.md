# **Build a Production-Ready Go Container Image: A Statically Linked Application**

You are tasked with optimizing the container image for a Go application. The application is a simple web service with a front page and a few API endpoints. The source code of the application is located in the ``~/app`` directory, along with an initial Dockerfile.

You can use the ``make docker-build`` command to build the image and ``make docker-run`` to run the container. However, the current setup does not adhere to containerization best practices. Your goal is to improve the Dockerfile and create a production-ready container image.

Build a Docker image named ``registry.iximiuz.com/app:v1.0.0`` that meets the following requirements:

1. Base Image:
    - Use a minimalistic base image.
    - All application's dependencies must be satisfied.
2. Security:
    - The image must run as a non-root user.
    - Ensure there is no shell in the image.
3. Performance:
    - The final image size must not exceed ``25 MB``.
4. Runtime:
    - The application must:
        - Listen on ``0.0.0.0:3000``.
        - Include all HTML files from the ``templates`` folder.
        - Include all assets from the ``static`` folder.
        - Serve APIs and static files correctly.
5. Testing:
    - Verify the application by running a container and checking the main page and the API handlers responses.

The final solution will be validated using automated checks. You can access dynamic hints from the checks by clicking the task box below.

Good luck! ðŸš€

> **Hint #2:**
>
> The problem with the application's original Dockerfile is that it includes the dev- and build-time dependencies in the final image. It includes not only the Go compiler, but also hundreds of other packages and tools that are not needed at runtime but increase the image size and the attack surface:

>
> To separate the build- and runtime dependencies, a **multi-stage Docker build** can be used:

> **Hint #3:**
>
> Even though our Go application is statically linked (i.e., doesn't depend on any external libraries like ``libc``), choosing the right base image for the runtime stage is still a tricky part.
>
> For instance, the (quite popular) ``FROM scratch`` approach won't work out of the box because the application requires a proper Linux rootfs layout and the certificate authority (CA) bundle.
> 
> Switching to a minimalistic but full-fledged Linux distro like ``alpine`` won't do the trick either because of the requirement not to include a shell in the image.
> 
> You can try carefully crafting [a custom FROM scratch image](https://labs.iximiuz.com/tutorials/pitfalls-of-from-scratch-images) adding the necessary system files, but a [distroless base image](https://labs.iximiuz.com/tutorials/gcr-distroless-container-images) might be a better choice:
