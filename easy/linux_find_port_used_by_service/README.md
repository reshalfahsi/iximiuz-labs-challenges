# **Classic Sysadmin Task: Which Port Is a Service Listening On?**

You have access to a Linux server running several services, including one named ``app``. Your objective is to identify the port that the ``app`` service is using. This is an easy problem, but proceed with caution - you have only **one attempt** to submit your answer.

Good luck!

> **Hint:**
>
> There are plenty of tools to list ports and/or used sockets on a Linux machine: ``netstat``, ``ss``, ``lsof``, etc. Pick one and try to figure out how to use it for this particular task.
