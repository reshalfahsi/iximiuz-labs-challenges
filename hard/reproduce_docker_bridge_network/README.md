Create two network namespaces representing two containers.

> **Hint #1:**
> 
> Don't know where to start? Try solving this simpler challenge first: [Create a Network Namespace](https://labs.iximiuz.com/challenges/linux-network-namespace).

Connect the two network namespaces with the host network namespace using virtual Ethernet pairs.

> **Hint #2:**
> 
> Solving the [Connect Two Network Namespaces](https://labs.iximiuz.com/challenges/connect-two-network-namespaces) challenge first might help you here.

Add the bridge interface, configure it, and connect the host ends of the virtual Ethernet pairs to the bridge.

Assign IP addresses to the container ends of the virtual Ethernet pairs and configure the routing to allow the host and the containers to communicate. At any given moment:

- The host should be able to ping ``netns0``.
- The host should be able to ping ``netns1``.
- ``netns0`` should be able to ping the host.
- ``netns1`` should be able to ping the host.
- ``netns0`` should be able to ping ``netns1``.
- ``netns1`` should be able to ping ``netns0``.

> The challenge you may want to solve first ðŸ‘‰ [Connect Multiple Network Namespaces](https://labs.iximiuz.com/challenges/connect-multiple-network-namespaces).

Set up Network Address Translation (NAT) on the host to allow the containers to communicate with the outside world.

> **Hint #4:**
>
> [Set Up Network Address Translation (NAT) for a Container](https://labs.iximiuz.com/challenges/set-up-nat-for-container) is a good challenge to solve first.

> **Hint #N:**
