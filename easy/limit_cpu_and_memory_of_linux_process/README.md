# **Limit CPU and Memory Usage of a Linux Process**

In this basic challenge, you will need to start a Linux process while limiting its CPU and memory usage. The binary you will run is called ``omnihog``, a simple resource hog program that consumes all available CPU and memory resources when started. Run it in a cgroup with a CPU limit of 10% and a memory limit of 500 MB.

Good luck!
