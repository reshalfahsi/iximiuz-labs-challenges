# **Forward a Port Using The Multipurpose Relay Tool: socat**

There is an HTTP service listening on port ``127.0.0.1:5000``. Your task is to make this service also available on ``0.0.0.0:6000``. You're not allowed to change the service configuration or restart it, and you should use ``socat`` to _map_ the port.
